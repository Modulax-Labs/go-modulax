About This Repository
Modulax Core is the backbone of the entire Modulax network. Written in Golang for maximum performance and concurrency, this repository contains the official implementation of our node software. It is the engine that processes transactions, executes smart contracts within our unique Post-Quantum EVM, maintains the security of the ledger through our Proof-of-Stake consensus, and communicates with other nodes across the globe.

üöÄ Key Features
Post-Quantum EVM Implementation: The core innovation, designed for future-proof security while maintaining full compatibility with the standard EVM toolchain.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus Engine: An efficient and decentralized consensus mechanism designed for high throughput and energy efficiency.

Full & Archive Node Sync Modes: Run the node in different modes to serve various network needs, from lightweight validation to full historical state archival.

EVM-Compatible JSON-RPC API: A comprehensive API that is fully compatible with Ethereum standards, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools and libraries.

üõ† Tech Stack
Golang: For building a high-performance, concurrent, and reliable distributed system.

PostgreSQL: For advanced indexing of blockchain data for high-performance queries.

gRPC: For efficient, high-performance communication between internal node services.

Libp2p: For the modular peer-to-peer networking stack.
