üìñ About Modulax Core
Welcome to the heart of the Modulax network. This repository contains the official Golang implementation of the Modulax node software. It is a high-performance, open-source blockchain client designed from the ground up to address the impending threat of quantum computing while providing full EVM compatibility for developers today.

This is where the core logic lives: the consensus engine, the peer-to-peer networking, and our groundbreaking Post-Quantum EVM (PQ-EVM) implementation.

üöÄ Key Features
üõ°Ô∏è Post-Quantum Security: Implements quantum-resistant signature schemes directly within the EVM, providing a future-proof foundation for all smart contracts.

‚ö° High-Performance PoS: A lightweight and efficient Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism designed for fast transaction finality and low energy consumption.

üåê EVM Compatibility: A fully compatible JSON-RPC API ensures that all existing Ethereum tools, libraries, and dApps work seamlessly with Modulax.

** modular Networking:** Built on libp2p for a robust and flexible peer-to-peer layer that is scalable and resilient.

üõ† Tech Stack
Primary Language: Go (Golang)

Networking: libp2p

Database: LevelDB

CLI: Cobra

üèÅ Getting Started
To get a local node running for development or testing, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Go (version 1.19 or later)

A C compiler (like GCC for LevelDB)
